# Insights-from-Edmunds-NLP
Edmunds is an American public website for the automotive industry where information about cars is available. Edmund has details like overviews, reviews, ratings, prices, and other features for all the car brands and their models. Users can write reviews about the cars and even leverage features like car finder, comparison tool, availability, etc, to make an informed decision about the vehicle they want to buy. Edmunds doesnâ€™t own the dealership; they only provide details about local dealers and their reviews on the website.
we looked at scraping at least 5,000 reviews from the Edmunds forum and then calculate lift values between the various brands highlighted in the comments to identify which brands are associated with each other according to consumers. To perform the brand analysis we used natural language processing on the data. After scraping, we create MDS plots and analyze how different brands associated with each other, along with highlighting the strategies that three different managers (namely brand manager, product manager, and advertising/marketing manager) can adopt based on our analysis.
